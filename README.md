# ScrollFusion
Scroll Fusion is a magic-based FPS-type game.

# Binaries
To obtain a binary for Scroll Fusion, there is a client download on the [Scroll Fusion Website](scrollfusion.co.uk) (click the '.bat and .exe' button), however this is likely to be out of date.
I highly suggest that you fork a copy to your account and compile the UE4/VS2015 project from source code.

# Versions
This is currently a VERY early version in development, so there is no real storyline, no amazing graphics, no properly baked lighting etc.
We have only completed the first few levels, so once there are enough to make the game playable, there should be a new binary for every 'checkpoint' in development.
